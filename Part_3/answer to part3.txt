----- PART 3 ANSWERS----

Imagine that based on the information we collected about how users interact with our page, 
we found that the filter was not well received by our users. We still believe that having 
a filter is a great feature for them, so:



1) Tell us about the possible reasons that the filter your implemented in part 2 
 did not help the customer experience?

 Reponse: Well I'm worried that with more data, my current implementation will run a bit slow, as I have to 
 map, then filter the cities once selected, which might make the user have to wait. Anything more than 3 seconds,
 and they'll most likely leave. 




2)What could you change to improve the filter experience, and why do you think it would be better 
for the customer?

 Reponse: I do agree that the filter is a feature worth having, I would just need to figure out a better way of 
 managing the data flow a bit better. It could be optimizing queries from the database, or API. 
 Depending on the overall size of the data, I might suggest implenting Redux to allow for faster and easier state management
 as well.
